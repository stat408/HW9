# HW9

### Q1. (5 points)

Include a link to your GitHub page that contains your first repo.

### Q2. (5 points)

Create your own R package called `stat408` and embed the following function:

```
go_cats <- function(){
  # sample function that returns 'go cats'
  # RETURNS: string saying 'go cats'
  return('go cats')
}
```

To verify this works, run the following command:
```
stat408::go_cats()
```

### Q3 (5 points - response not required)
The point of this question is to discuss the best possible way to finish the course. For the week of March 23rd, there will be a set of video lectures and this homework assignment, but no lab. I have set up 5 modules for the remaining weeks of the class. My current thought would be to have a recorded video lecture in place of our traditional Tuesday class. Students can work in groups (remotely, of course), alone, or I will work through the labs using a live video conference (likely Google Hangouts Meet or Webex).

#### a. 
Do you have any suggestions about the structure of the course for the last 5 weeks?

#### b. 
What are you most concerned about with the remainder of this course?

#### c. 
What can I do to help you sucessfully complete this course?
